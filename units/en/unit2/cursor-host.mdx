# Using Your MCP Server in Cursor AI

<CourseFloatingBanner chapter={2} classNames="absolute z-10 right-0 top-0" />

**See your MCP server in action!** This integration demonstrates how your Gradio-based sentiment analysis server works seamlessly with professional development tools like **Cursor AI** through the MCP protocol.

<Tip>

This showcases the power of MCP: build with Gradio, deploy on Spaces, integrate with smolagents, and use anywhere—including professional IDEs like Cursor. MCP makes this interoperability effortless!

</Tip>

## Why This Integration Matters

This section demonstrates the **complete workflow**:

- **Gradio**: Rapid prototyping and MCP server creation
- **HF Spaces**: Free, instant deployment and hosting
- **smolagents**: Seamless MCP client integration
- **Cursor AI**: Professional development environment with built-in MCP support

You'll see how these tools create a **production-ready pipeline** from development to deployment to real-world usage.

<Tip>

Cursor AI acts as the **Host** (the user-facing application), while its built-in MCP functionality serves as the **Client** component that manages communication with your MCP server.

</Tip>

## The Complete Ecosystem in Action

### What You've Built
1. **Gradio MCP Server**: Created a sentiment analysis tool with automatic MCP protocol support
2. **HF Spaces Deployment**: Hosted your server for free with global accessibility
3. **smolagents Integration**: Connected your server to AI agents seamlessly

### Now: Professional IDE Integration
Connect your **MCP server** directly to **Cursor AI** for daily development use.

## Quick Setup

### Prerequisites
- Cursor AI editor
- Your sentiment analysis server deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces**

### Configuration

Open Cursor settings (`Ctrl + Shift + J` / `Cmd + Shift + J`) → **MCP** tab → **Add new global MCP server**:

**macOS:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sentiment-analysis": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://YOURUSENAME-mcp-sentiment.hf.space/gradio_api/mcp/sse", "--transport", "sse-only"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Windows:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sentiment-analysis": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "mcp-remote", "https://YOURUSENAME-mcp-sentiment.hf.space/gradio_api/mcp/sse", "--transport", "sse-only"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Experience the Integration

Ask Cursor AI to use your sentiment analysis tool:
- "Analyze the sentiment of this user feedback"
- "Check if this code comment is positive or negative"
- "Help me understand the tone of this pull request description"

## What You've Accomplished

You've experienced the **complete MCP pipeline**:

1. **Built** with Gradio's MCP-enabled interface
2. **Deployed** on Hugging Face Spaces for global access
3. **Integrated** with smolagents for AI agent workflows
4. **Connected** to professional development tools like Cursor

This demonstrates how **Hugging Face's ecosystem** enables you to go from idea to production-ready AI tools that work across the entire development landscape.
