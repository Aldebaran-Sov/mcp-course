# Cursor AI Integration

<CourseFloatingBanner chapter={2} classNames="absolute z-10 right-0 top-0" />

The most seamless way to use our MCP sentiment analysis is directly within **Cursor AI** using the built-in MCP support. This integration allows you to perform sentiment analysis directly in your coding workflow without leaving your editor.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Cursor AI integration, ensure you have:
- Cursor AI editor installed
- Node.js and npm installed on your system
- Access to the sentiment analysis MCP server

## Configuration

Instead of manually editing JSON files, you can configure the MCP server directly through Cursor's settings interface:

### Step 1: Open MCP Settings

Use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + J` (or `Cmd + Shift + J` on Mac) to open Cursor settings, then navigate to the **MCP** tab from the left sidebar.

### Step 2: Add New MCP Server

1. Click **"Add new global MCP server"** to open the configuration panel
2. Fill in the server configuration with the following details:

*MAC*
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sentiment-analysis": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://YOURUSENAME-mcp-sentiment.hf.space/gradio_api/mcp/sse",
        "--transport",
        "sse-only"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

*Windows*
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sentiment-analysis": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": [
        "/c",
        "npx",
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://YOURUSENAME-mcp-sentiment.hf.space/gradio_api/mcp/sse",
        "--transport",
        "sse-only"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

Once configured, you can directly interact with Cursor AI's Agent for sentiment analysis:

### Basic Sentiment Analysis

Ask Cursor AI to analyze text sentiment:
- "Analyze the sentiment of this text: 'I love this product!'"
- "What's the sentiment of: 'This is terrible'"
- "Check sentiment: 'It's okay, nothing special'"

### Batch Analysis

For multiple text samples, you can ask Cursor to analyze them sequentially:
- "Analyze the sentiment of these comments: [list your text samples]"

## Benefits

This integration provides several advantages:

- **Seamless Workflow**: No need to switch between applications or run separate scripts
- **Real-time Analysis**: Get instant sentiment feedback while coding
- **Context Awareness**: Analyze text directly from your editor without copy-pasting
- **Development Efficiency**: Integrate sentiment analysis into your development process

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Cursor AI integration:

1. **Configuration Issues**: Verify that your `mcp.json` file is properly formatted and located in the correct directory
2. **Connection Problems**: Ensure you have internet access and the MCP server is available
3. **Permission Errors**: Check that Cursor AI has the necessary permissions to access the configuration file

Make sure to restart Cursor AI after modifying the MCP configuration file for changes to take effect.
