# Advanced MCP Development: Building Custom Workflow Servers for Claude Code

Welcome to Unit 3! In this unit, we'll build a production-ready MCP server that enhances Claude Code with custom development workflows.

## What You'll Build

**Development Workflow Server** - An MCP server that makes Claude Code team-aware and workflow-intelligent:

- **Smart PR Management**: Automatic PR template selection based on code changes
- **Post-Actions Automation**: React to GitHub Actions completion via webhooks and orchestrate follow-up tasks
- **Team Communication**: Slack notifications with intelligent summaries of workflow results
- **Claude Code Integration**: Connect your server so Claude Code understands your team's specific processes

## Real-World Case Study

We'll implement a practical scenario every development team faces:

**Before**: Developer manually creates PRs, waits for Actions to complete, manually checks results, remembers to notify team members

**After**: Claude Code connected to your workflow server can intelligently:
- Suggest the right PR template based on changed files
- Monitor GitHub Actions runs and provide formatted summaries
- Automatically notify team via Slack when deployments succeed/fail
- Guide developers through team-specific review processes based on Actions results

## Key Learning Outcomes

1. **Production MCP Server Architecture**: Security, error handling, and webhook management
2. **GitHub Actions Integration**: Monitoring Actions runs, parsing results, and orchestrating follow-up workflows
3. **Claude Code Enhancement**: Making Claude Code team-specific and workflow-aware
4. **Multi-System Coordination**: Connecting GitHub, Slack, and CI/CD monitoring through a unified MCP interface

## Tutorial Structure

1. **Server Foundation**: Build the core MCP server with proper authentication and error handling
2. **PR Template Intelligence**: Implement smart template selection based on file changes
3. **Actions Monitoring**: Set up webhooks to track GitHub Actions completion and parse results
4. **Slack Integration**: Create formatted notifications based on workflow outcomes
5. **Claude Code Connection**: Configure Claude Code to use your workflow server
6. **End-to-End Testing**: Demonstrate the complete workflow from PR creation to team notification

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Units 1 and 2
- Basic familiarity with GitHub Actions and webhook concepts
- Claude Code installed and configured
- Access to a GitHub repository for testing

By the end of this unit, you'll have a production-ready MCP server that transforms Claude Code into a powerful team development assistant.
